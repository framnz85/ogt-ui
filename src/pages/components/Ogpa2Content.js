            Hi, ako nga pala si Francis Clavano and I am a full-time online entrepreneur.
            <br /><br />

            I am also an online coach for more than 8 years teaching and mentoring thousands of people all over the Philippines on how to CREATE and BUILD a Successful Online Grocery Businesses.
            <br /><br />

            <center><img src={MentoringGroup} alt="Mentoring Group" style={{width: "100%"}} /></center>
            <br />

            The picture above are the people in my mentoring and coaching team. Over the years of doing my online grocery business I already earned a gross income of <span style={{color: "green", fontWeight: "bold"}}>more than 10 Million pesos</span>.
            <br /><br />

            But let me take you first back to the time when I don't have this business yet. The time when I was still struggling how to make money online.
            <br /><br />

            Like you I was also dreaming of <span style={{color: "#0096FF"}}>having a profitable business</span>. Before I quitted my job, I have ventured into a lot of businesses. I have 2 internet cafe, some fruit businesses, and I also ventured in lending business.
            <br /><br />

            <i>"Pero sadly lahat <b>nalugi</b>!"</i>
            <br /><br />

            They don’t succeed because I’m still doing the old fashion way of doing business. Kung baga nasa traditional business pa rin lahat ng ginagawa ko. Naubos nalang lahat ng savings ko at gaya ng karamihan sa atin, ako ay nabaon sa utang. 
            <br /><br />

            One time when I was reading my Facebook timeline, I read a statement from the richest guy on Earth (Bill Gates), he says…
            <br /><br />

            Bill Gates: <i>"If your business is not on the internet then your business will be out of business".</i>
            <br /><br />

            At that moment I quietly tell myself... AHA! Kaya pala hindi nagsa-succeed ang mga businesses ko dahil hindi ko ginagamit ang internet sa pagbebenta ng mga products and services ko.
            <br /><br />

            That statement of Bill Gates is not just prophetic but it is really happening now!!!
            <br /><br />

            <span style={{color: "#0096FF"}}>In fact, pinabilis pa nga ito nung nagka pandemya!!!</span> That’s why at that moment I immediately started to think what other types of business will I get into where that business can be made online, sustainable and long-term.
            <br /><br />

            So, I consider a business which I can sell consumable goods online such as <u>fruits, vegetables, diapers, and rice</u>.
            <br /><br />

            To the point, I finally get into...
            <br /><br />

            <center><h2 style={{color: "green"}}>Selling Grocery Items Online</h2></center>
            <br /><br />

            Last June 2015, I started my Online Grocery Business here in Davao City.
            <br /><br />

            What I do is that I created an Ecommerce Website and uploaded all the Grocery Items that I can buy at the nearest supermarket. Customers will just land on my website, pick the grocery item they need to buy and add it to their cart. Once completed they just send me their payment thru bank transfer or thru Gcash or to any payment option that I set.
            <br /><br />

            After I receive their payments, I immediately go to the nearest Supermarket and buy those products they’ve order. Then, I deliver it to their house or they may also pick them up.
            <br /><br />

            I arrived selling grocery products online because of these <b style={{color: "#0096FF"}}>very Practical & Profitable Reason</b>.
            <br /><br />

            <b>Grocery Items are being bought from the suppliers only after a customer orders and pays it which means…</b>
            <br /><br />
            
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>&#10004;</span> You <b style={{ color: "green" }}>don’t need to have money na pang-capital</b> para ibili sa mga groceries na iyong ibebenta
            <br /><br />
            
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>&#10004;</span> Which in contrast you <b style={{ color: "#0096FF" }}>don’t need to stock grocery products</b> kasi nga bibilhin mo lang ang mga yun at idedeliver kaagad sa customer kung bayad na.
            <br /><br />
            
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>&#10004;</span> And since you don’t need stocks, you also don’t need money to build a physical building para sa storage.
            <br /><br />

            Let me illustrate it to you on the video below.

            <br />

            <span style={{color:"brown"}}>What makes the website so efficient is that you are not limited only to grocery products.</span>
            <br /><br />

            If you have other products (non-grocery) na benebenta or kung halimbawa nag-aangkat ka ng mga produkto sa China or sa other countries at benebenta mo dito sa Pinas, then you can also use the website to sell it online.
            <br /><br />

            <span style={{color:"violet"}}>And because of the internet it will not be hard for you to find customers in any business today.</span> In fact, there is actually a very powerful marketing strategy that only a few online grocery owners are using today to acquire lots of customers!
            <br /><br />

            Watch the video below to learn abput this new strategy.
            <br /><br />

            <center>

            </center>
            <br />

            What makes it more powerful is that people all over the world will be invited to go to this catalog to check what online grocery and other online store can serve them.
            <br /><br />

            Once they find out that your online grocery business can serve them then they will instantly become your regular customers.
            <br /><br />

            So, if you are doubtful kung saan ba manggagaling ang mga customers na bibili sa mga grocery products na benebenta sa website mo then this is the genuine way for it.
            <br /><br />

            In fact, I myself is already using this strategy to my own online grocery and it provides me a lot of sales!
            <br /><br />

            <span style={{color:"green"}}>Let me show you one of my actual profit when I use this strategy. Last time, I delivered 4 orders to my customers.</span>
            <br /><br />

            <center><img src={SampleDelivery} alt="Sample Delivery" width={ isMobile ? "100%" : ""} /></center>
            <br /><br />

            I earned a net profit of P 1,641.14 (10% of the sale + delivery fees) and it only took me 2 hours to deliver these orders to my customers.
            <br /><br />

            <i>"This is a proof that you can really earn a significant amount of money using this strategy and it is also possible to have a business that you only need to spend 2 hours a day to earn a net income of 1,600 pesos"</i>
            <br /><br />

            It's already an income of a junior manager in a company working 8 hours within the same day and is an income na mas malaki pa kaysa sa daily income ng mga sari-sari store or small grocery store that needs 12 to 16 hours a day of work.
            <br /><br />

            Now if it provides big income for only 4 orders, <span style={{color:"red"}}>imagine how much revenue it can give you if you have 8, 10, 20, or more orders a day.</span>
            <br /><br />

            <center><h2 style={{color: "green"}}>That would be a lot of money, right?</h2></center>
            <br />

            At yan yung kinikita na ngayon ng mga naging students ko using the same exact strategy. Sila yung tinuruan ko sa loob ng sampung araw paano gagawin ang online grocery business at nabigyan ko na rin ng website.

            <br /><br />

            <center><h2 style={{color: "green"}}>How Much Is This Program?</h2></center>
            <br />

            By now, you must be excited to enroll in this premier program and start making serious money online with grocery products. 
            <br /><br />

            But before I jump into the details, let's compare first a traditional business like a physical grocery store vs. an online grocery business that I'm sharing to you.
            <br /><br />

            
            <b>1. Supermarket Business</b> (Needs millions to start)
            <br />

            <div style={{paddingLeft: 20}}>
                In this type of business, you need to do a lot of things. You need to connect to a lot of people and you need a lot of money in order for you to start this kind of business. You need at least tens or even a hundred millions to start. Not every Pinoy has that kind of money to start.
            </div>
            <br />

            <b>2. Sari-sari or Small Grocery Store</b> (Needs P50,000 to P100,000 to start)
            <br />

            <div style={{paddingLeft: 20}}>
                In this type of business, you still need at least 50,000 to 100,000 pesos to start. This is because kailngan mong mamuhunan sa itatayo mong building at sa mga products na idi-display mo sa iyong tindahan.
                <br /><br />

                During every live webinar I have conducted, most of my participoant said that their daily income in their sari-sari or small grocery store ranges from around 200 to 500 pesos only per day. Most of the time, ito yung mapait, utang pa! 
                <br /><br />

                And they need 12 to 15 hours per day to operate it. You invest a very large amount to start but then your daily income just range from 200 to 500, maswerte nalang kung aabot ng 1,000 per day net income.
                <br /><br />
                
                And you need to spend 12 to 15 hours per day to operate.
            </div>
            <br />

            <b>3. Online Grocery Business</b> (Needs less than P10,000 capital for the payment of the Grocery Website)
            <br />
            
            <div style={{paddingLeft: 20}}>
                Hindi mo kailangan ng malaking halaga at hindi maliit ang kita online grocery business, you need only less than 10,000 capital. And that is only for the ayment of the website.
                <br /><br />
                
                However, you don't need 10,000 pesos to start Online Grocery Business thru what I am going to teach you and the income potential of this Online Grocery Business is ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 pesos per day and the good thing it is cash.
                <br /><br />

                Walang utang and it can go as high as 28,000 pesos in one day gaya ng pinakita ko sayo sa taas. In this business you don't need 12 to 15 hours per day. In fact, you can do online grocery business 2 to 4 hours at hindi siya every day.
                <br /><br />

                You can do it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Yes, you need to spend only 2 to 4 hours per Monday, per Wednesday, and per Friday.
                <br /><br />

                Bakit ganun?
                <br /><br />
                
                Kasi yung website ang magta-trabaho para sayo during Saturday, Sunday and Monday ng morning saka sa Monday afternoon mo sya tatrabahuin, 2 to 4 hours a day. Same thing with Wednesday and Friday.
                <br /><br />

                However, it is still up to you when do want your Online Grocery Business to be operated. You can also do per day.

            <center><h2 style={{color: "green"}}>Cost Of Creating A Grocery Website</h2></center>
            <br />

            Before I also proceed into the details of the program, I would like to show you the cost kung magpapagawa ka ng website sa iba. I found out that hiring a web programmer would cost you around <b>50,000 pesos to 100,000 pesos</b> to do an e-commerce website.
            <br /><br />

            Depende na rin sa looks at functionality na gusto mong meron nito at <u>hindi pa kasali dyan ang maintenance and hosting cost</u>. Website’s maintenance and hosting cost would range from $20 (P1,000) to $100( P5,000) every single month.
            <br /><br />

            But in the OGPA Program, I will not going to ask you 100,000 pesos or even half of that which is 50,000 pesos. I will not also ask you even 10,000 pesos. And I will not going to ask you 1,000 pesos to 5,000 pesos per month for the maintenance and web hosting cost.
            <br /><br />

            Because to enroll OGPA Program which includes the Grocery Website and the OGPA Workshop, you only need to pay a one time setup fee of P{amount.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",")} only. And a monthly subscription rate (for maintenance and hosting) of only P550 a month!
            <br /><br />

            What’s best about this is that the monthly subscription fee will only start 3 months after your website is completed. Meaning meron kang libreng 3 months para magamit at ma-explore ng mabuti ang iyong website.
            <br /><br />

            <center><h2 style={{color: "red"}}>But You Need To Take Action Now</h2></center>
            <br />

            This is not to scare you or para pilitin ka na mag-enroll agad but yung kakayanan naming gumawa ng website is up to 20 websites lang per schedule. This is because yun lang din ang kaya ng mga programmer namin. Sila yung mga professional we hired para gumawa ng website mo.
            <br /><br />

            And since mga tao lang din naman sila, they have limitations. So if you want to start your Online Grocery Business then secure a spot now by enrolling to this program.
            <br /><br />

            Right now, there are already {spotTaken} people that jump in to this program. So, {spotLeft} spots nalang yung natitita. Once all the spot have been taken or until midnight of Sunday, whichever comes first, we will end the enrollment for the program.

            Paano kung meron na akong existing na sari-sari store or grocery store?
            <br /><br />

            <b style={{color:"green"}}>ANSWER</b>
            <br />

            Kung meron ka nang existing na tindahan pwede mong gawin is to upgrade it into online grocery. The process is very simple, still follow all the lessons I’ll be giving you on the OGPA Program, get also the Grocery Website.
            <br /><br />
 
            Once an order has been made by a customer, those products na inorder ng customer na andun na sa tindahan mo kukunin mo nalang deretso dun. At yung wala yan yung kukunin mo sa pinakamalapit na supermarket or supplier.
            <br /><br />

            <b style={{ color: "violet" }}>QUESTION</b>
            <br />

            What if gusto kong simulan pero wala pa akong pampuhunan?
            <br /><br />

            <b style={{color:"green"}}>ANSWER</b>
            <br />
            
            Don’t go into something that you are not 100% well decided. My advise is don’t enroll yet! 
            <br /><br />

            But of course, in every action there is always a consequences. What’s the consequence? You will waste time. Na sana yung oras na ginamit mo sa paghihintay para magkaroon ng puhunan ay ginamit mo na sana para simulan ang business at kumikita na ng malaki.
            <br /><br />
 
            Yung {amount.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",")} pesos na ginamit mo to enroll and have a website ay possible pwede mo namang mabawi ng mabalis. Look at yung mga kinikita na ng mga past students ko, they already earning 5,000 pesos, 10,000 pesos, at may iba pa 28,000 pesos na in 1 day. But again, nasa sayo pa rin yan.

            <br />
            
            Yes but not immediately. My advise is build your online grocery first. Kuha ka muna ng DTI Permit as a start and start selling. Once you already see na dumadami na at may regular customer ka na then that’s the time na kukuha ka na unti-unti ng mga other permits like Mayors Permit, BIR, etc.
            <br /><br />
